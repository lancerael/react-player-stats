# React Player Stats

A simple React app to display player stats.

## Installation

Install Node.JS (https://nodejs.org/) and NPM:

```npm install npm -g```

Navigate to folder and install app:

```npm install```

You can then use NPM to manage project tasks.

## DEV SERVER

Uses Webpack/Babel with plugins, performs linting on build (watcher)

```npm run serve```

You can then access the server at http://localhost:8081 which launches the sandbox.

## PRODUCTION BUILD

Minifies and creates production ready in ./dist folder

```npm run dist```

## Technologies

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass)

## Enhancements?

With more time I would like to add:

* Unit tests
* Loader display
* Redux state management
